### 2024-2025 School Year
- Minibot docu
- NARDash docu
- submodules must be removed before making a push to a branch (people trying to access thatbranch with a submod pushed will deny them access), meaning that these should be for development purpose, we must still rely on releases. implement a .gitignore to account for this
- Yearly Integration docu
- Practicals -> common errors and how to account
- if you run into an indexing error when trying to shift branches, attempt running "git submodule update (--remote)"

### IDEAS FOR CONTROL INNOVATION
- NARASK web
  - quick search engine for documentation/solutions
  - web version of the github
  - includes visuals
- NARDDash
  - "click n go", drive through interaction with the dashboard
  - wasd swerve control, arrow keys to turn
  - unit testing
  - doglog visualization
  - visual CAN robot issue
- NARPit
  - battery logging system
  - lending tracker
- LED
  - 
- Common
- Robot
  - JSON, toggling subsystems, certain config, constants?
  - annotations, epilogue
  - auto pid tuning
